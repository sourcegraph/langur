# To accommodate the following requirements:
#
# 1. We want to have symbolic names for languages (instead of
#    strings) for better auto-completion when using an IDE.
# 2. The upstream languages.yml file sometimes removes languages.
# 3. We don't want to bump the major version number every time
#    we bump Linguist version (and hence run the chance of
#    removing certain cases)
#
# We maintain the list of languages that we removed from Linguist.
